Considered Naivasha’s best-kept secret, Chui Lodge offers very comfortable accommodation in a spectacular location! It’s an excellent option for travellers seeking something special in the Rift Valley region. Chui Lodge is one of two properties situated within the Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary. This sanctuary was established by Hans and June Zwager and their son Peter in 1995, with the joint aim of conserving the area’s wildlife and managing human–wildlife conflicts to enable both local communities and animals to thrive. Chui combines well with a safari in the Maasai Mara or Amboseli National Park – please contact one of our experts to discuss your options! The accommodation at Chui is usually booked on a full-board basis and the lodge is open throughout the year. Chui Lodge is a 2.5-hour drive from Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, or a twenty-minute flight from Nairobi. It’s an easy drive from Nairobi and the road conditions are good, although the last stretch is a bit bumpier because of potholes. The Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary surrounding Chui Lodge was created in the mid-1990s with the sole purpose of giving the resident wildlife a place of safety and refuge. To keep illegal cattle grazers out of the sanctuary and wildlife from straying into the farmlands, the sanctuary is surrounded by electric fences. The wildlife is still able to move freely between the neighboring Hell’s Gate National Park and the lake shore by way of wildlife corridors, which are areas that act as a safe transition zone for migratory animals. This stimulates constant movement throughout the localized ecosystem. Within the private 18,000-acre Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary you can find over 50 mammal species including leopard, hyena, wildebeest, hartebeest, waterbuck, eland, Grevy’s zebra, buffalo, Impala, dikdik and giraffes. Lions occasionally use the wildlife corridors but never stay too long in the area. The sanctuary also has various birds! Apart from the smaller birds, we spotted for example the African Fish Eagle, Somali Ostrich, Secretary bird, and vultures.

          <h2>Oserian Two Lakes Experience with Chui Lodge</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            A lot of tourists traveling to Lake Naivasha don’t know there is a second volcanic crater lake next to Lake Naivasha, called <b>Lake Oloidien. </b>  For a few years now, the two lakes are connected due to the high-water level. The name ‘Oloidien’ means salty. Lake Oloidien was originally a freshwater lake connected to Lake Naivasha, but in the late 1990s, it became very salty, probably due to the lack of outlets for the water. This increase in salinity led to the death and migration of many animals and birds. Despite this, the lake's high salt content was suitable for lesser flamingos, which made their home there until climate change caused the waters of Lake Oloidien and Lake Naivasha to mix, reducing the salinity of Oloidien and leading to the flamingos' disappearance. Although Flamingos disappeared, there is still a varied range of birds that can be observed when you visit the two lakes, like African fish eagles, cormorants, kingfishers, herons and pelicans. You will also find many hippos across the lake. The surrounding dead trees make it a picture-perfect place to visit. The best time to do a boat tour on the Oserian two lakes is in the early morning. Chui Lodge offers boat tours in a normal wooden boat or a speed boat.          </p>

The deluxe rooms offer a more private view of the garden or the waterhole and the Rift Valley escarpment, including the Wildlife Sanctuary. All rooms have a unique decor, making each room completely different from one another. The banda's are named after local families, which all have their own stories. Chui Lodge in Naivasha was originally built as guest accommodation by the long-time owners of the neighboring Oserian flower farm. June Zwager built and designed the lodge with the help of local craftsmen using sustainable materials such as bush stone, acacia, olive, and leleshwa wood sourced from within the sanctuary. Its unique craftsmanship with curved and bent walls resulted in private dining nooks and cozy areas with a fireplace. The intricate African carvings and murals, as well as African antiques and ochre-colored walls in the dining room, lounge, and bar, create a gallery-like atmosphere that invites guests of Chui Lodge to enjoy the beauty and culture of the region. The main area and cottages are surrounded by a beautiful green garden characterized by lush greenery, colorful flowers, well-maintained paths, and lovely views. Chui Lodge offers a peaceful getaway in the African bush, with plenty of space and privacy for guests. Wildlife viewing from your private patio At Chui Lodge, wildlife comes very close to the lodge. While having lunch in the beautifully manicured garden or relaxing on our private patio, we had nice sightings of buffalo, giraffes, zebra, and eland drinking at the nearby waterhole. Apart from mammals, there are plenty of birds to spot and we even had a leopard tortoise visiting our patio. The leopard tortoise is part of the little five (or small five). The lodge also has a large (heated) swimming pool with views of the waterhole and wildlife sanctuary. A great place to relax in between your safari game drives and cool off on these hot summer days. For cooler days, the swimming pool has a pleasant temperature because it's heated. From a boat cruise on Lake Naivasha and guided game drives on the wildlife sanctuary, to bush breakfasts, candlelit dinners, bush walks, hikes up to the hill, and a visit to the local flower farm, Chui lodge offers plenty of things to do during your stay near Lake Naivasha. Chui’s professional safari guides will tailor morning, afternoon, or night game drives in the Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary. Hartebeest, eland, giraffes, buffalo, wildebeest and zebra are very common animals to see on a game drive, The definition of a game drive on safari is: ‘a guided excursion or self-drive by (preferably 4-wheel drive) open-sided safari vehicle in a National Park, reserve, or conservancy to spot and observe African... The Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary is also home to the endangered Grevy’s zebra, known as the imperial zebra, which is the largest of the three zebra species. This species isn't native to this area, but the sanctuary is trying to breed them. During the game drive, your guide will find a lovely spot to have a sundowner. Because Chui lodge is located in a privately owned sanctuary, they are able to set up a campfire. These are all perfect ingredients for a memorable sundowner. in the African bush. Chui lodge offers lovely outdoor settings to have bush dinner or bush breakfast. It’s truly a special and memorable experience that allows you to connect with nature while enjoying delicious food and drinks with friends or loved ones. I love these outdoor bush breakfasts or bush dinners. Chui lodge will be happy to assist you with any requests you may have. They offer much more beautiful settings, like breakfast on the shores of Lake Oloidien and Lake Naivasha under the shade of an acacia in the heart of the wildlife sanctuary, and starlit dinners with the sound of the African bush. Definitely one of the reasons why Chui Lodge is the best place to stay at Lake Naivasha. Did you know there are about 220 flower farms in Kenya, and that about 70 of them are located near Lake Naivasha? We visited De Ruiter flower farm, one of Kenya’s leading cut flower farms, that exports its products to the European Union and Dutch markets and known for its colorful roses. Apart from De Ruiter flower farm, you're able to visit the Oserian flower farm. It was originally a cattle ranch with only 16 employees, but the owner Hans Zwager turned it into a successful flower farm in 1982 that has been Fairtrade certified since 2003. Visiting a flower farm is a great opportunity to learn about the process of growing, harvesting, and exporting flowers. When staying at Chui Lodge in Naivasha, a boat tour on lake Naivasha has to be on your Kenya bucket-list. Lake Naivasha is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including hippopotamuses, birds, and a variety of fish species. It’s surrounded by beautiful scenery, including lush forests, rolling hills, and grassy wetlands. A boat tour is a great way to take in these stunning landscapes and to photograph them from a unique perspective. The calm waters of the lake together with the peaceful surroundings provide a welcoming break from the hustle and bustle of the daily life and can help you to recharge and rejuvenate. One of the best ways to see birds in Naivasha is on a bush walk with an experienced guide from Chui Lodge. Guests can explore the shores of Lake Oloidien or enjoy a bush walk inside the Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary. At the shores of the two lakes, you can find Black-winged Stilt, Pied Kingfisher, Hottentot Teal, and Great Cormorant. The yellow fever acacia forests that border the lake are frequently visited by leopards, Colobus monkeys, eland, and waterbuck, which makes this Chui Lodge bush walk a remarkable experience. If you want to experience the best of both worlds - bush & lake experience - I highly recommend booking your stay with Chui Lodge Naivasha. You will not only experience a boat safari on the two lakes spotting the amazing birdlife and hippos, but you will also see plenty of wildlife in the surrounding African bush with a high chance of leopard sightings. Chui is the swahili word for leopard.          </p>

          <h2>The STORY </h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
From 5-star luxury lodges to the boutique Ranch House Bistro, an 18,000-acre wildlife sanctuary and prime real estate, Oserian Two Lakes has it all. The Zwager family has created a tourism venture consisting of a luxury safari lodge, Chui Lodge & a boutique lake side restaurant, Ranch House Bistro. These provide the opportunity for people to stay and explore the Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary and experience for themselves conservation in practice. Funds raised through tourism are reinvested into the Oserian Two Lakes conservation programs. Around an hour and a half drive from Nairobi, Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary is a privately owned, 18,000 acre, flora and fauna paradise. It is home to a diversity of wildlife that includes: Leopard, Grevy’s Zebra, Masai Giraffe, Bat-eared fox, Buffalo, Hyena, Aardvark and many other plains game. The wildlife sanctuary and surrounding lakeshore is host to over 400 bird species such as, African Fish Eagle, Narina Trogon, Grey-crested Helmet-shrike, Rufous-crowned Roller, Spotted Eagle-Owl and Somali Ostrich. By staying at either Chui Lodge or Kiangazi House, you can enjoy all of this diverse and unique wildlife from one of our open or closed safari 4X4 land cruisers. With the expert knowledge of our friendly and professional guides, you will find hours will pass by like minutes. Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the central part of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya, west of the Aberdare ranges and north east of the Mau escarpment. It borders both Lake Naivasha and Lake Oloidien - the highest lakes along the floor of the rift Valley. The topography of the land comprises the elevated Maiella ridge that raises 7,748 ft. above sea level to the lower plains on the East that stretch to the shores of the Lakes Oloidien and Naivasha at 6,200fts above sea level. The Great Rift Valley is a vast geographical and geological feature, approximately 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) in length, which runs from northern Syria to central Mozambique. The rift valley varies in width from thirty to one hundred kilometers, and in depth from a few hundred to several thousand meters. This massive geological split runs through the heart of East Africa and the Kenyan section of the Rift Valley is home to eight lakes. Lakes Turkana, Logipi, Bogoria, Nakuru, Elementaita and Magadi are all alkaline lakes and are famous for the large flocks of Flamingos that feed on crustaceans. The only freshwater lakes are Baringo and Naivasha

          <p style="text-align:justify;">
The wildlife sanctuary surrounding Chui Lodge was created in the mid 1990’s with the sole purpose of giving the resident wildlife a place of safety and refuge. Over 18, 000 acres is surrounded by an electrified fence, as much to keep illegal cattle grazers out as it is to keep the wildlife from straying into the nearby farmlands. The wildlife are still able to move freely between the neighboring Hell’s Gate National Park, the sanctuary and the lakeshore by way of wildlife corridors which ensures constant movement throughout the localized eco-system.

Over 18, 000 acres is surrounded by an electrified fence, as much to keep illegal cattle grazers out as it is to keep the wildlife from straying into the nearby farmlands. The wildlife are still able to move freely between the neighboring Hell’s Gate National Park, the sanctuary and the lakeshore by way of wildlife corridors which ensures constant movement throughout the localized eco-system. Since the creation of the sanctuary and the wildlife corridors the number of wildlife, specifically species such as leopard and giraffe, persecuted by the villages in the past, has stabilized and increased to sustainable levels. Whilst lions do occasionally visit, such as George the lion who was a full time resident for more than 5 years, there is a pressing need to “predator proof” the fence surround the Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary and to turn our sporadic predator presence into a full time programme. This will allow natural control of the ever-increasing numbers of certain herbivore species within the sanctuary. Within the sanctuary and game corridors we have over 50 mammal species, some of these include, Leopard, Topi, Grevy’s zebra, Impala, Serval cat, Warthog, and Lesser Galago. Naivasha is a main stop for many migratory birds, and plays a huge role in hosting the breeding grounds for numerous species. All year round we have over 400 species of birds that thrive in the different ecosystems that are part of Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary. To say the least we are a birders paradise, some common sightings are Klaas’s Cuckoo, Long-crested Eagle, Spectacled Weaver and Black-backed Puffback.               </p>
